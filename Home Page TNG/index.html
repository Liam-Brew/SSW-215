				<p class="text">Hello! My name is Liam Brew. I am a sophmore Software Engineering student here at Stevens and am taking SSW 215. I am very excited for this course as I am interested in web development and would like to one day create and host my own website. I'm looking forward to a great semester!</p>			
				<p class="text">I attended West Hempstead High School in West Hempstead, New York and graduated in 2017. In high school, I always enjoyed my STEM classes the most, with Calculus, Geometry and Physics being my favorites. In addition to these, I also took a leading role in two extracurriculars, my school's VEX Robotics Team and scientific research program. I believe that it is this combination of experiences, all of which were positive, which encouraged me to look further into a career into a career in Engineering.</p>
				<p class="text">Although it may be a lot of hard work, I am definitely enjoying my Stevens experience so far. Not only have I learned alot, I've met an awesome group of like-minded people who share many similar interests with me. These people represent not only the start of my professional network but also life-long friends and fellow "survivors" of Stevens. In addition to my classes, I am involved in several extracurriculars, most notable of which are the Software Engineering Club and C2GS.</p>
				<p class="text">This assignment allowed me to experiment with something that I have been planning for a while: a blog website. By incorporating the content from the initial rendition of my homepage as well as adding a little more (such as the two previous paragraphs), I played around with creating a uniform style for similar to how posts of a blog tend to look the same. I used classes to allow for better organization in addition to potential future post-submission scripting.</p>

				<p class="text">I am currently enrolled in my fourth semester here at Stevens. While SSW 215 represents my first true software engineering course, I have taken before classes that deal both with technical skills such as coding as well as more "softer" skills such as project management. I value both of these sets of experience equally, as I am interested in the programming proportion of software engineering just as much as I am its leadership and mission-oriented design components. Located below you will find a list of courses which I found relevant to software engineering, each with my grade recieved and number of credits earned.</p>
